  <h2>1. Apps Covered</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy applies to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Huni</strong> – an app for watching short videos in series form and exploring products in the Store.
      You can follow shops, save items to cart and send order requests to sellers.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Huni Studio</strong> – an app for creators and sellers to upload videos, create products and manage their shop

  <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>

  <h3>2.1 Huni (viewer &amp; buyer app)</h3>
  <p>
    Huni does <strong>not require an account</strong> and we do not ask you to provide your name, email address
    or other direct identifiers just to watch content.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>On-device data:</strong> bookmarks, watch history, followed shops, cart data and order history may be stored locally
      on your device. This data may remain on your device until you clear it (for example by reinstalling the app or clearing app data).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Order information (when you send an order request):</strong> if you choose to place an order request in the Store,
      we collect information necessary for the seller to fulfill the order, such as recipient name, phone number,
      shipping address, notes (if provided) and the products ordered. This information is delivered to the seller’s account
      in <strong>Huni Studio</strong> to process and fulfill the order.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Reports &amp; safety signals (if you use report / block features):</strong> we may collect the content identifier,
      your selected reason and any optional message you provide, to review and handle abuse and safety issues.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Technical data:</strong> our delivery and hosting providers may receive standard technical information such as IP address,
      device type, operating system version and error logs in order to operate, secure and debug the service.
      We do not use this information to personally identify you.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.2 Huni Studio (creator / seller app)</h3>
  <p>To operate creator and seller features, Huni Studio collects the following data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Account information:</strong> email address, password (handled by our authentication provider and not stored in plain text),
      display name, username.

    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Order information:</strong> order requests sent from Huni are stored and shown in Huni Studio so the seller can fulfill them,
      including recipient name, phone number, shipping address, notes (if provided) and the products ordered.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Reports &amp; safety signals:</strong> reports submitted by users or creators (including reasons and content identifiers)
      may be stored for review, moderation and abuse prevention.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Technical data:</strong> similar to Huni, our infrastructure providers may receive IP address, device information and error logs
      to operate and protect the service.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>

  </ul>
  <p>We do <strong>not sell</strong> your personal data to third parties.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing and Service Providers</h2>
  <p>
    We use third-party service providers (for example, cloud hosting, databases, content delivery, authentication and payment processing)
    to run Huni and Huni Studio. These providers may process your data on our behalf only to provide these services and are not allowed
    to use it for their own marketing.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Seller sharing for orders:</strong> when you send an order request in Huni, we share the necessary order and contact details
    with the seller responsible for fulfilling the order, and the order is delivered to the seller’s account in <strong>Huni Studio</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If required by law, or to protect our rights or other users, we may disclose limited information to authorities following applicable legal processes.
  </p>

  <h2>5. On-device Storage &amp; Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Some data (such as watch history, followed shops, cart data and order history) may be stored only on your device.
    </li>
    <li>
      Order data may be stored as long as needed to provide the service, support sellers in fulfilling orders, comply with legal obligations,
      or resolve disputes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Account, content and order data in Huni Studio are kept as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the service,
      comply with legal obligations or resolve disputes.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can request deletion of your Huni Studio account and related personal data by contacting us (see Contact section below).

  </ul>

  <h2>6. Ads &amp; Payments</h2>
  <p>Huni currently has no advertising.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Physical goods orders in Huni:</strong> Huni allows you to send order requests to sellers for physical goods.

    Huni does <strong>not</strong> process payments for physical goods orders and does not receive your payment card details for those orders.
  </p>
  <p>
    Huni does not act as the merchant of record for physical goods orders placed through the app.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Huni Studio subscriptions:</strong> Huni Studio may offer optional in-app purchases (for example, a Huni Studio Pro subscription or similar).
    Payments are processed by the platform provider (such as Apple). We do not receive your full payment card details; we only receive information
    necessary to confirm that a purchase was successful (for example, subscription status / entitlement).

      or account information.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Privacy Policy – Huni &amp; Huni Studio</h1>
  <p>Last updated: 2025-12-08</p>

  <h2>1. Apps Covered</h2>

    This Privacy Policy applies to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Huni</strong> – a lightweight app for watching short videos in series form.</li>
    <li><strong>Huni Studio</strong> – an app for creators and sellers to upload videos,
      create products and manage their shop and orders within the Huni ecosystem.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>

  <h3>2.1 Huni (viewer app)</h3>
  <p>
    Huni does <strong>not require an account</strong> and we do not ask you to provide
    your name, email address or other direct identifiers in the app.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>On-device data:</strong> bookmarks, watch history and settings may be
      stored locally on your device and are not sent to our servers unless clearly stated.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical data:</strong> our delivery and hosting providers may receive
      standard technical information such as IP address, device type, operating system
      version and error logs in order to operate, secure and debug the service. We do not
      use this information to personally identify you.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.2 Huni Studio (creator / seller app)</h3>
  <p>To operate creator and seller features, Huni Studio collects the following data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account information:</strong> email address, password (handled by our
      authentication provider and not stored in plain text), display name, username.</li>
    <li><strong>Profile &amp; shop information:</strong> avatar, banner image, channel or
      shop description and contact details that you choose to show to customers.</li>
    <li><strong>Content you upload:</strong> videos, images, captions, product
      information (name, price, description, options, photos).</li>
    <li><strong>Order information:</strong> for each order we store details necessary for
      fulfillment, such as recipient name, phone number, shipping address and the
      products ordered. This information is shared with the seller handling that order.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical data:</strong> similar to Huni, our infrastructure providers
      may receive IP address, device information and error logs to operate and protect
      the service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To create and maintain your Huni Studio account and shop.</li>
    <li>To store and display the content and products you upload.</li>
    <li>To process and show orders so that sellers can fulfill them.</li>
    <li>To operate, secure and improve our apps, including debugging and preventing abuse.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not sell</strong> your personal data to third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing and Service Providers</h2>
  <p>
    We use third-party service providers (for example, cloud hosting, databases, content
    delivery, authentication and payment processing) to run Huni and Huni Studio. These
    providers may process your data on our behalf only to provide these services and are
    not allowed to use it for their own marketing.
  </p>
  <p>
    If required by law, or to protect our rights or other users, we may disclose limited
    information to authorities following applicable legal processes.
  </p>

  <h2>5. On-device Storage &amp; Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Some data (such as watch history or draft content) may be stored only on your
      device.</li>
    <li>Account, content and order data in Huni Studio are kept as long as your account
      is active or as needed to provide the service, comply with legal obligations or
      resolve disputes.</li>
    <li>You can request deletion of your Huni Studio account and related personal data by
      contacting us (see Contact section below).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Ads &amp; Payments</h2>
  <p>
    Huni currently has no advertising and no in-app purchases.
  </p>
  <p>
    Huni Studio may offer optional in-app purchases (for example, a Huni Studio Pro
    subscription or similar). Payments are processed by the platform provider (such as
    Apple). We do not receive your full payment card details; we only receive information
    necessary to confirm that a purchase was successful.

    child has provided us with personal data, please contact us so that we can delete it.

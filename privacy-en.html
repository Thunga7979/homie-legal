      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <b>Công ty TNHH Homie Open</b> (“<b>Homie Open</b>”, “<b>we</b>”, “<b>us</b>”)
        collects, uses, and shares information when you use the <b>Huni</b> mobile app and related services (the “<b>Service</b>”).

    <h2>1) Apps Covered</h2>
    <p>
      This Policy primarily covers <b>Huni</b> (viewer app). If you also use <b>Huni Studio</b> (creator/seller app),
      the same principles apply: we collect only what is needed to operate the features you choose to use.
      Some data categories described below apply only when a feature is available and enabled.
    </p>

    <h2>2) Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Information you provide</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Support requests.</b> If you contact us, we receive the information you provide (e.g., email, message content, screenshots).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Reports & safety messages.</b> If you use in-app <b>Report</b> features, we may collect your selected reason and any optional
        message you submit, plus identifiers needed to find the reported item (e.g., content/channel ID) to review abuse and safety issues.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Account information (if you choose to sign in).</b> Huni can be used without signing in. If you choose to create an account
        or sign in (where available), we may receive identifiers from the authentication provider (such as email address or a provider ID)
        and basic profile fields you choose to set (such as display name).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Orders / shopping requests (if available).</b> Some versions of the Service may allow you to submit an order request or contact
        a seller. In that case, we collect the details you enter (e.g., recipient name, phone number, shipping address, notes, and items)
        and deliver them to the seller/creator account so they can fulfill your request.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 On-device data (stored locally)</h3>
    <p>
      To personalize your experience and improve performance, Huni may store certain data <b>on your device</b> (e.g., using local storage/cache),
      such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Followed channels/shops, blocked channels, and related preferences</li>
      <li>Watch history and playback settings (e.g., volume/mute, player configuration)</li>
      <li>Cached images/thumbnails and other temporary performance files</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">
      You can typically clear on-device data by uninstalling the app or clearing the app’s storage/cache in your device settings.
    </p>

    <h3>2.3 Push notifications (optional)</h3>
    <p>
      If you enable notifications, we may collect and store a <b>push token</b> (e.g., an Expo/APNs token) and basic delivery metadata
      (such as timestamps and delivery status) to send you notifications (for example, new content updates or important service messages).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Notification preferences.</b> Your opt-in/opt-out status and preference settings may be stored to respect your choices.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Identity linking (guest vs. signed-in).</b> To avoid duplicate notifications and to deliver notifications correctly, the Service may
        associate a push token with a guest identifier on your device and/or with your user account if you sign in.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.4 Subscriptions / In-App Purchases (Huni Premium)</h3>
    <p>
      If you purchase <b>Huni Premium</b> via Apple In-App Purchase, payments are processed by <b>Apple</b>. We do <b>not</b> receive your
      full payment card details. We may receive information necessary to provide Premium access, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Subscription status/entitlement (active/expired)</li>
      <li>Product identifier (e.g., monthly subscription), transaction timestamps, and restore results</li>
      <li>Receipt/transaction verification signals (where applicable)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.5 Technical and usage data</h3>
    <p>
      Like most online services, our infrastructure and service providers may process standard technical data to operate and secure the Service:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>IP address, device type/model, OS version, app version, language/region</li>
      <li>Crash reports and basic diagnostic logs (for debugging and stability)</li>
      <li>Network and performance metrics (e.g., load times, errors)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">
      We use this information for service operation, security, debugging, and reliability—not to try to personally identify you.
    </p>

    <h2>3) How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Provide the Service</b>: stream and display content, enable follow/block, and maintain your settings.</li>
      <li><b>Premium access</b>: verify and provide subscription entitlements if you purchase Premium.</li>
      <li><b>Notifications</b>: send notifications only if you opt in, and honor your preferences.</li>
      <li><b>Safety</b>: review reports, reduce abuse, and enforce community safety rules.</li>
      <li><b>Improve reliability</b>: diagnose crashes, fix bugs, and improve performance.</li>
      <li><b>Support</b>: respond to questions and handle requests.</li>
      <li><b>Legal</b>: comply with applicable law and protect users and our rights.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>We do not sell</b> your personal data.</p>

    <h2>4) How We Share Information</h2>
    <p>
      We share information only as needed to operate the Service:
    </p>

    <h3>4.1 Service providers (processors)</h3>
    <p>
      We use third-party providers for hosting, databases, content delivery, push notifications, and security. These providers process
      data on our behalf to provide their services and are not permitted to use it for their own marketing. Examples may include:
      cloud infrastructure, content delivery networks (CDNs), push notification delivery services, and authentication providers.
    </p>

    <h3>4.2 Apple (payments)</h3>
    <p>
      If you purchase Premium, Apple processes the payment and manages subscriptions. Apple’s own policies apply to payment processing.
    </p>

    <h3>4.3 Sellers / creators (only if you request an order or contact)</h3>
    <p>
      If the Service allows order requests or seller contact and you choose to submit one, we share the necessary details with the relevant
      seller/creator so they can fulfill your request.
    </p>

    <h3>4.4 Legal and safety</h3>
    <p>
      We may disclose information if required by law, or to protect users, prevent fraud/abuse, or enforce our terms and policies.
    </p>

    <h2>5) Storage & Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>On-device data</b> (e.g., follows, preferences, cache) remains until you clear it or uninstall the app.</li>
      <li><b>Push tokens</b> are retained while notifications are enabled and for a reasonable period to prevent duplicates and deliver messages.</li>
      <li><b>Report data</b> is retained as needed for safety review, enforcement, and audit logs.</li>
      <li><b>Account data</b> (if you sign in) is retained while your account is active and as needed for legal and operational reasons.</li>
      <li><b>Order/contact requests</b> (if available) are retained as needed to provide the service and resolve disputes or comply with law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6) Your Choices & Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Notifications:</b> You can enable/disable notifications in device settings at any time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>On-device data:</b> You can clear cache/storage in device settings or by reinstalling the app (device-dependent).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Access / deletion requests:</b> You may request access, correction, or deletion of certain personal data (especially account-related data)
        by contacting us at <a href="mailto:homieopen7979@gmail.com">homieopen7979@gmail.com</a>. We may need to verify your request.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Subscriptions:</b> You can manage or cancel subscriptions in your App Store account settings. Restore purchases is available in the app.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">
      Note: Some data may be retained where required by law or for legitimate business purposes (e.g., fraud prevention, security logs).
    </p>

    <h2>7) Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information from unauthorized access,
      loss, misuse, or alteration. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
    </p>

    <h2>8) International Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on where you live and where our providers operate, your information may be processed in other countries.
      We take steps to protect your information consistent with this Policy and applicable law.
    </p>

    <h2>9) Children</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is intended for a general audience and is not directed to children under the minimum age required by local law
      (typically <b>13</b>). If you believe a child has provided us personal data, contact us and we will take steps to delete it where appropriate.
    </p>

    <h2>10) Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have questions about this Policy or data practices, contact:
      <a href="mailto:homieopen7979@gmail.com">homieopen7979@gmail.com</a>
    </p>

    <h2>11) Changes</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available on this page and the “Last updated”
      date will be revised accordingly.
